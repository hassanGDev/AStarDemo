# AStarDemo
Simple A* implementation

This source code shows a very simple implementation of A-Star pathfinding using C#.

There are some options in the program file to allow the use of three different types of hueristic (Pyhtagorean, Pythagorean without sqroot, and manhattan), and two different movement types (either four directional, NSEW, or eight way movement).

All source code is MIT licensed, feel free to use it as you wish.
